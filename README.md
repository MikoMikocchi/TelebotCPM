# TelebotCPM

My first C# Telegram Bot. Library used: Telegram.Bot v21.11.0 (https://github.com/TelegramBots/Telegram.Bot)

This is a russian bot about Cultural points in Moscow. The bot reads the json file and shows the list one object at a time depending on the selected directory.

Was made in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022. To use bot, install the latest Telegram.Bot library and Newtonsoft.Json. 

Move "token.txt" and "cultural_points.json" into "TelebotCPM/bin/Debug/net8.0" folder.
Type your Telegram Bot token into empty txt. file "token.txt". Just one token without anything else.
