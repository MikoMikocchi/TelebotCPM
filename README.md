# TelebotCPM

My first C# Telegram Bot. Library used: Telegram.Bot v21.11.0 (https://github.com/TelegramBots/Telegram.Bot)

This is a russian bot about Cultural points in Moscow. The bot reads the json file and shows the list one object at a time depending on the selected directory. Was made in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022. To use bot, install the latest Telegram.Bot library and Newtonsoft.Json. Type your Telegram Bot token into empty txt. file "token.txt". Just one token without anything else.
